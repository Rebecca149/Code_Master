# üíª Code_Master (frontend-project)

## üåç Overview
Code Master is a website designed for coding newbies (such as bootcampers or those who are self-taught) to consolidate and test their learning all in one place. The site currently includes a scored quiz, flashcards, and a resource page with links to useful websites that may enhance the user's learning. This project was completed in week 7 of the School of Code bootcamp and I worked in collaboration with 3 amazing fellow bootcampers!

## Planning
### ü§ù Team Manifesto
Before we even knew what the project would entail, we created a team manifesto. This involved each of us making brief notes on our expectations from the rest of the team. Once we had done this, we talked through and explained our notes as a group and compiled a manifesto from this by condensing the wording and combning any duplicate idead. <br><br>
Here is a selection of some items of our manifesto:
- Maintain a blameless culture
- Be welcoming of constructive feedback from peers
- Everyone has equal opportunity to share their thoughts
- Have generational discussions, rather than positional
- Commit to the result of a dot vote

### üß† Brainstorming Ideas
The challenge for this project was to create a tool that would help bootcampers with a problem they may face. As the four of us were bootcampers ourselved, we decided to individually brainstorm some problems that we have each faced over the course of our learning journey so far. Similarly to the creation of the maifesto, we than came together to talk through our ideas, highlighting any common themes. It became clear that there were 3 common issues we faced. These were: <br>

- Difficulty in organising/scheduling self-study time
- Feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new knowledge to learn and struggling to retain syntax
- Keeping up to date with notes taken during learning

### Dot Voting

We implemented dot voting throughout the project to speed up the decision making process and to avoid potential conflicts. An example of when we used this method was when deciding on which of the three bootcamper problems we would try to address with our product.<br><br> Here is the result of this vote:

<br>
As a result of tis vote we decided to focus on the second bootcamper problem, although we also decided that it may be possible to incoporate elements of the first as well.

### User Story
An essential part of any project is to clearnly define the challenge by writing a user story. This is exteremely helpful in keeping the project focused and prevent the team from strayign too far from the project brief. <br>

We used the 'as a... I want... so that...' struture for our user story: <br>

~ <em>"As a bootcamper, I want a tool that will help me to consolidate my understanding so that I can progress through the course confidently"<em>
