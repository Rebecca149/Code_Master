# üíª Code_Master (frontend-project)

## üåç Overview
Code Master is a website designed for coding newbies (such as bootcampers or those who are self-taught) to consolidate and test their learning all in one place. The site currently includes a scored quiz, flashcards, and a resource page with links to useful websites that may enhance the user's learning. This project was completed in week 7 of the School of Code bootcamp and I worked in collaboration with 3 amazing fellow bootcampers!

## Planning
### ü§ù Team Manifesto
Before we even knew what the project would entail, we created a team manifesto. This involved each of us making brief notes on our expectations from the rest of the team. Once we had done this, we talked through and explained our notes as a group and compiled a manifesto from this by condensing the wording and combning any duplicate idead. <br><br>
Here is a selection of some items of our manifesto:
- Maintain a blameless culture
- Be welcoming of constructive feedback from peers
- Everyone has equal opportunity to share their thoughts
- Have generational discussions, rather than positional
- Commit to the result of a dot vote

### üß† Brainstorming Ideas
The challenge for this project was to create a tool that would help bootcampers with a problem they may face. As the four of us were bootcampers ourselved, we decided to individually brainstorm some problems that we have each faced over the course of our learning journey so far. Similarly to the creation of the maifesto, we than came together to talk through our ideas, highlighting any common themes. It became clear that there were 3 common issues we faced. These were: <br>

- Difficulty in organising/scheduling self-study time
- Feeling overwhelmed by the amount of new knowledge to learn and struggling to retain syntax
- Keeping up to date with notes taken during learning

### Dot Voting

We implemented dot voting throughout the project to speed up the decision making process and to avoid potential conflicts. An example of when we used this method was when deciding on which of the three bootcamper problems we would try to address with our product.<br><br> Here is the result of this vote:

<br>
As a result of tis vote we decided to focus on the second bootcamper problem, although we also decided that it may be possible to incoporate elements of the first as well.

### User Story
An essential part of any project is to clearnly define the challenge by writing a user story. This is exteremely helpful in keeping the project focused and prevent the team from straying too far from the project brief. <br>

We used the 'as a... I want... so that...' structure for our user story: <br>

~ <em>"As a bootcamper, I want a tool that will help me to consolidate my understanding so that I can progress through the course confidently"</em>


### User Personas
Each member of the team created a breif user persona to capture the diverse demographic of our product. These personas had varying ages, employent background etc and would remind us over the course of the project that we needed to cater to these very different individuals. The creation of user personas also reduces the somewhat abstract nature of solving a problem for a large group of users as it makes the developer feel more personally connected to the people they are aiming to help with their product.
 
### üí≠ Disney ideation
The process of Disney ideation is split into three 'rooms'. First is the 'dreamer room' in which the team can be as creative as possible with no considerations to limiting factors such as the project timescale. Secondly is the 'realist room', where the team suggests ideas that could feasibly be achived, taking inspiration from the dreamer room ideas. Lastly is the 'critic room' in which potential flaws and difficuties in the ideas from the realist room are identified. <br><br>
  
The pool of ideas resulting from this method were creative, realistic and the main hurdles we would face with each had already been identified. <br><br>
Again, we dot voted on the ideas we wished to take forward.

### The MVP
The MVP (or Minimum Viable Product) is the most basic product that fulfils the project brief. We took the three most popular ideas resulting from the Disney Ideation dot vote and noted the most basic criteria for sucess for each. These were: <br>
  - One working quiz with 10 questions that keeps track of the user's score
  - A page of resources for the user to conduct further learning
  - 10 flashcards on a particular topic that can be cycled through in some way
  
### üìà Stretch Goals
There were many, more ambitious goals that we would have liked to have achieved during the project week. After completing the MVPs we had time to complete a few, such as:

- Adding styling (e.g. an accessible colour palette and a logo)
- Multi-page routing, allowing the user to navigate between the quiz, flashcards, and resource page
- Alert telling the user their score in the quiz
- Selection pages where the user can choose the topic they want to study

There were also some stretch goals we could not achieve in the timescale of the project, including:

- Difficulty selection on the quiz
- Re-asking of incorrectly answered quiz questions
- Extra topcs added to the flashcards and quiz
- A point system where the user gets points for completing more quizzes
- Filterable resources e.g. by media type, topic, difficulty etc
- A login system

### User Flow

## üé® Design
### Accessible colour palatte

There were many considerations we had to take into account when generating a suitable colour palette. As with any good website, we ensured that the colours we selected would be accessible to as many users as possible, including those with colour-blindness, dyslexia, and partial-sightedness. <br>

<img width="497" alt="Our colour palatte" src="https://github.com/Rebecca149/Code_Master/assets/123400925/59f5a1dc-6971-4455-8542-1deb6b0600eb">

We decided upon blue as the core colour of our site. This is because it is commonly associated with stability and calmness. It is a colour often found in educational settings and websites and so will hopefully encourage the user to learn. Two dark and two light shades of blue were chosen to achieve the desired level of contrast on the page. Additionally, a briht shade of yellow was selected as an accent colour and to make the page more visually appealing. <br><br>

We used an accesibility tool to test whether our colour palatte had a suficcient contrast ratio. This provided the combinations of colours that could be next to each other on the page.

### Logo

Our logo was designed in Canva and incoporates the colours in our palatte. We wanted the blocks to resemble puzzle pieces to represent learning and problem solving.
